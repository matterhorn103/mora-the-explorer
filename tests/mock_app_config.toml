# Provide the following information for each spectrometer category:
#   spec_dir: the name of the folder for the spectrometer in \\mora\nmr
#   date: the way dates are formatted, defining <date> - for the format codes see
#       https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-strptime-behavior
#   check_paths: the paths that should be searched for new spectra
#   archives: if spectra from previous years can't be found under check_paths, give the
#             names of archive folders for previous years, including the date format
#   include: other spectrometer categories which should be searched at the same time
#   manufacturer: the manufacturer of the spectrometer(s)
#   display_name: the text shown next to the button in the user interface
#                 (note that some characters need escaping, e.g. write && for &)
#   date_entry: whether the user selects the full date "dd MMM yyyy" or just year "yyyy"
#   allow_solvent: whether to enable the folder naming option to include the solvent
#   single_check_only: whether users may use multiday and repeat checks for this spec
#   restrict_to: the list of groups that should be able to see the spectrometer - if
#                this key is not used, the spectrometer will be visible to all
#
# Possible variable fields are:
# - <spec_dir>      (the value of `spec_dir`)

# - <group>         (the chosen group's initialism)
# - <group name>    (the chosen group's name)
# - any strftime formatting string, with % characters, enclosed in <>
